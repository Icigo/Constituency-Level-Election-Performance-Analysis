# Constituency-Level-Election-Performance-Analysis

## Problem Statement

Atliq Media is a private media company and they wanted to telecast a show on lok sabha elections 2024 in india. Unlike other channels they do not want to have a debate on who is going to win the elections, they rather wanted to present insights from 2014 and 2019 elections without any bias and discuss less explored themes like voter turnout percentage in india.

### Questions from Available data
1. List top 5 / bottom 5 constituencies of 2014 and 2019 in terms of voter turnout ratio?
